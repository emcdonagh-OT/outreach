- users_requests.csv from support email and hands-on workshops

This document will help us  keep track of wishes and requests from users via support email and from the feedback survey completed at the end Open Targets hands-on workshops. 

We will check how frequent the request is made by independent users.

Them we will ee IF/WHEN we can implement the changes (to be discussed in internal meetings).

If the changes get implemented, usability testing will be carried out and the feedback of those will be available in elsewhere.

This document is NOT an inventory of feedback gathered through usability testings of new or current aspects of the Platform. This is available elsewhere in Google Docs.
