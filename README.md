- users' requests from support email and hands-on workshops

users_request.csv will help us to keep track of wishes and requests from users via support email and from the feedback survey completed at the end Open Targets hands-on workshops.

This document is NOT an inventory of feedback gathered through usability testings of new or current aspects of the Platform. This is available elsewhere in Google Docs.

- twitter strategy


- conferences
