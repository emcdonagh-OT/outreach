# Outreach Tracking

Open Targets Repo for tracking some Outreach activities:

- todo_blog.csv: possible themes to be published at http://blog.opentargets.org
We had 448 visits in a two month window (e.g. Nov-Jan 17).
Overall, the highest number of visits match the dates when a new post is released. Not surprising.
So, we need your help. We need to keep readers engaged and coming back to our blog, and then giving the Platform a go.

The latest table of blog post ideas is here: https://airtable.com/invite/l?inviteId=invot0pK9NFXRndPO&inviteToken=aeac153e3742cbaaf027fc7d36058ef9 

Have you got an idea of a blog post but you don't know where to start? Get in touch.

- users requests:
Users get in touch through a variety of channels (social media, email support, face-to-face). They may report bugs or request new features/data. We need to triage them before putting the request into place and implementing the change. Usability testing will be carried out and the feedback of those will be available collated.
