# Outreach

Open Targets Repo for tracking some Outreach activities:

• todo_blog.csv: possible themes to be published at http://blog.opentargets.org

We had 2,335 page view and 1,904 unique page view visits in a two month window (i.e. Jun-Aug 18).

Overall, the highest number of visits matches the dates when a new post is released.
So, we need your help. 
We need to keep readers engaged and coming back to our blog, and then giving the Platform a go.
The more authors we have, the better we perform in search engines.

The latest table of blog post ideas is here: https://github.com/opentargets/outreach/blob/master/todo_blog.csv

• users get in touch through a variety of channels (social media, email support, face-to-face). They may report bugs or request new features/data. We need to triage these before putting the request into place and implementing the change. Usability testing will be carried out and the feedback of those will be available collated. These are useful files:
