# Outreach Tracking

Open Targets Repo for tracking some Outreach activities:

- todo_blog.csv: possible themes to be published at http://blog.opentargets.org

We had 2,335 page view and 1,904 unique page view visits in a two month window (i.e. Jun-Aug 18).

Overall, the highest number of visits matches the dates when a new post is released.
So, we need your help. 
We need to keep readers engaged and coming back to our blog, and then giving the Platform a go.
The more authors we have, the better we perform in search engines.

The latest table of blog post ideas is here: https://github.com/opentargets/outreach/blob/master/todo_blog.csv
Have you got an idea of a blog post but you don't know where to start? Get in touch.

- user requests:
Users get in touch through a variety of channels (social media, email support, face-to-face). They may report bugs or request new features/data. We need to triage them before putting the request into place and implementing the change. Usability testing will be carried out and the feedback of those will be available collated.
