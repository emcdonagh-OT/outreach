1,LD, I'd like to have the LD tables from Ensembl in Open Targets (Paola Bronson - Biogen),support email, platform issues triage #6, We already link out to the Variant tab in Ensembl which has among other things link to LD.
2, All associations,I'd like to be able to view in a table (and download) the associations for a gene (or SNP) all in one place (Paola Bronson - Biogen), support email, platform issues triage #6, We display the genomic context of a gene and its SNPs with associations upon clicking the lollipops. Could a table be provided? GWAS catalog provides this. Shall we replicate it? Shall we link out to them (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/search?query=clec16a). Need to be careful: we may want to change the focus of people: instead of looking at every single SNP to taking the whole genomic region at once.
